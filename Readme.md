# 👗 Fashion Recommendation System using Image Features

A deep learning-based fashion recommendation system that uses computer vision and similarity matching to suggest similar fashion items based on image features.

## 📖 About

This project implements a fashion item recommendation system that uses deep learning to extract features from fashion images and find similar items based on visual similarity. The system processes images using a pre-trained CNN model and computes similarity scores to recommend the most similar fashion items.

## ✨ Features

- **Image Feature Extraction**: Uses pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, ResNet, etc.) to extract deep features from fashion images
- **Similarity Matching**: Implements cosine similarity and other distance metrics to find similar items
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy user interaction
- **Multiple Fashion Categories**: Supports various clothing types (shirts, dresses, pants, shoes, etc.)
- **Real-time Recommendations**: Instant similarity results with uploaded images

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

Using the Recommendation System

# Example usage in code
from recommendation_system import FashionRecommender

# Initialize the recommender
recommender = FashionRecommender()
Model Selection: Choose between different pre-trained models
Similarity Metrics: Cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, etc.
Top-K Recommendations: Number of similar items to display
Feature Dimensions: Adjust feature vector size

#🧠 Methodology
Technical Approach
Feature Extraction:

Use pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, ResNet50)
Extract features from intermediate layers
Create feature vectors for each image

#Similarity Calculation:
Compute distance between feature vectors
Use cosine similarity for robust comparisons
Rank items by similarity scores

#Recommendation Engine:

Find top-K most similar items
Filter by category if needed
Return ranked recommendations

📊 Results
The system provides:

Visual similarity-based recommendations
Multiple similar item suggestions
Confidence scores for each recommendation
Fast inference time for real-time usage
