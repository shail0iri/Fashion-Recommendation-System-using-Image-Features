# 👗 Fashion Recommendation System using Image Features

A deep learning-based fashion recommendation system that uses computer vision and similarity matching to suggest similar fashion items based on image features.

## 📖 About

This project implements a fashion item recommendation system that uses deep learning to extract features from fashion images and find similar items based on visual similarity. The system processes images using a pre-trained CNN model and computes similarity scores to recommend the most similar fashion items.

## ✨ Features

- **Image Feature Extraction**: Uses pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, ResNet, etc.) to extract deep features from fashion images
- **Similarity Matching**: Implements cosine similarity and other distance metrics to find similar items
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy user interaction
- **Multiple Fashion Categories**: Supports various clothing types (shirts, dresses, pants, shoes, etc.)
- **Real-time Recommendations**: Instant similarity results with uploaded images

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shail0iri/Fashion-Recommendation-System-using-Image-Features.git
cd Fashion-Recommendation-System-using-Image-Features
```

Install required dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Required Dependencies
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Using the Recommendation System

```python
# Example usage in code
from recommendation_system import FashionRecommender

# Initialize the recommender
recommender = FashionRecommender()

# Get similar items
similar_items = recommender.get_similar_items(image_path, top_k=5)
```

🔧 Configuration
The system can be configured through:

1. Model Selection: Choose between different pre-trained models
2. Similarity Metrics: Cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, etc.
3. Top-K Recommendations: Number of similar items to display
4. Feature Dimensions: Adjust feature vector size

🧠 Methodology
Technical Approach
1. Feature Extraction:
   Use pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, ResNet50)
   Extract features from intermediate layers
   Create feature vectors for each image

2. Similarity Calculation:
   Compute distance between feature vectors
   Use cosine similarity for robust comparisons
   Rank items by similarity scores

3. Recommendation Engine:
   Find top-K most similar items
   Filter by category if needed
   Return ranked recommendations

📊 Results
The system provides:

Visual similarity-based recommendations.
Multiple similar item suggestions.
Confidence scores for each recommendation.
Fast inference time for real-time usage.
