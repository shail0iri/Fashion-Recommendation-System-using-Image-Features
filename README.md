# 👗 Fashion Recommendation System using Image Features

A deep learning-based fashion recommendation system that uses computer vision and similarity matching to suggest similar fashion items based on image features.

## 📖 About

This project implements a fashion item recommendation system that uses deep learning to extract features from fashion images and find similar items based on visual similarity. The system processes images using a pre-trained CNN model and computes similarity scores to recommend the most similar fashion items.

## ✨ Features

- **Image Feature Extraction**: Uses pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, ResNet, etc.) to extract deep features from fashion images
- **Similarity Matching**: Implements cosine similarity and other distance metrics to find similar items
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy user interaction
- **Multiple Fashion Categories**: Supports various clothing types (shirts, dresses, pants, shoes, etc.)
- **Real-time Recommendations**: Instant similarity results with uploaded images

## 🛠️ Installation
